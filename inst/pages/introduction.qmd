# Introduction {#sec-msintro}

## How does mass spectrometry work?

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technology that *separates* charged
molecules (ions) based on their mass to charge ratio (M/Z). It is
often coupled to chromatography (liquid LC, but can also be gas-based
GC). The time an analyte takes to elute from the chromatography
column is the *retention time*.

```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="A chromatogram, illustrating the total amount of analytes over the retention time.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/chromatogram.png")
```

An mass spectrometer is composed of three components:

1. The *source*, that ionises the molecules: examples are Matrix-assisted
   laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) or electrospray ionisation.
   (ESI)
2. The *analyser*, that separates the ions: Time of flight (TOF) or Orbitrap.
3. The *detector* that quantifies the ions.

When using mass spectrometry for proteomics, the proteins are first
digested with a protease such as trypsin. In mass shotgun proteomics,
the analytes assayed in the mass spectrometer are peptides.

Often, ions are subjected to more than a single MS round. After a
first round of separation, the peaks in the spectra, called MS1
spectra, represent peptides. At this stage, the only information we
possess about these peptides are their retention time and their
mass-to-charge (we can also infer their charge by inspecting their
isotopic envelope, i.e the peaks of the individual isotopes, see
below), which is not enough to infer their identify (i.e. their
sequence).

In MSMS (or MS2), the settings of the mass spectrometer are set
automatically to select a certain number of MS1 peaks (for example
20)^[Here, we will focus on data dependent acquisition (DDA), where
MS1 peaks are selected. In data independent acquisition (DIA), all peaks
in the MS1 spectrum are fragmented.]. Once a narrow M/Z range has been
selected (corresponding to one high-intensity peak, a peptide, and
some background noise), it is fragmented (using for example
collision-induced dissociation (CID), higher energy collisional
dissociation (HCD) or electron-transfer dissociation (ETD)). The
fragment ions are then themselves separated in the analyser to produce
a MS2 spectrum. The unique fragment ion pattern can then be used to
infer the peptide sequence using de novo sequencing (when the spectrum
is of high enough quality) or using a search engine such as, for
example Mascot, MSGF+, ..., that will match the observed, experimental
spectrum to theoretical spectra (see details below).

```

The animation below show how 25 ions different ions (i.e. having
different M/Z values) are separated throughout the MS analysis and are
eventually detected (i.e. quantified). The final frame shows the
hypothetical spectrum.

```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="Separation and detection of ions in a mass spectrometer.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

```

The figures below illustrate the two rounds of MS. The spectrum on the
left is an MS1 spectrum acquired after 21 minutes and 3 seconds of
elution. 10 peaks, highlited by dotted vertical lines, were selected
for MS2 analysis. The peak at M/Z 460.79 (488.8) is highlighted by a
red (orange) vertical line on the MS1 spectrum and the fragment
spectra are shown on the MS2 spectrum on the top (bottom) right
figure.

```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="Parent ions in the MS1 spectrum (left) and two sected fragment ions MS2 spectra (right)", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

```

The figures below represent the 3 dimensions of MS data: a set of
spectra (M/Z and intensity) of retention time, as well as the
interleaved nature of MS1 and MS2 (and there could be more levels)
data.

```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="MS1 spectra over retention time.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

```

```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="MS2 spectra interleaved between two MS1 spectra.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

```

## Accessing data

### From the ProteomeXchange database

MS-based proteomics data is disseminated through the
[ProteomeXchange](http://www.proteomexchange.org/) infrastructure,
which centrally coordinates submission, storage and dissemination
through multiple data repositories, such as the
[PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/)
database at the EBI for mass spectrometry-based experiments (including
quantitative data, as opposed as the name suggests),
[PASSEL](http://www.peptideatlas.org/passel/) at the ISB for Selected
Reaction Monitoring (SRM, i.e. targeted) data and the
[MassIVE](http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp)
resource. These data can be downloaded within R using the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("rpx")` package.

```{r rpx}
library(rpx)
```

Using the unique `PXD000001` identifier, we can retrieve the relevant
metadata that will be stored in a `PXDataset` object. The names of the
files available in this data can be retrieved with the `pxfiles`
accessor function.

```{r pxd}
px <- PXDataset("PXD000001")
px
pxfiles(px)
```

Other metadata for the `px` data set:

```{r pxvar}
pxtax(px)
pxurl(px)
pxref(px)
```

Data files can then be downloaded with the `pxget` function. Below, we
retrieve the raw data file. The file is
downloaded^[If the file is already available, it is not downloaded a second time.]
in the working directory and the name of the file is return by the
function and stored in the `mzf` variable for later use ^[This and other files are also availabel in the `msdata` package, described below].

```{r pxget}
fn <- "TMT_Erwinia_1uLSike_Top10HCD_isol2_45stepped_60min_01-20141210.mzML"
mzf <- pxget(px, fn)
mzf
```

### Data packages

Some data are also distributed through dedicated packages. The
`r BiocStyle::Biocexptpkg("msdata")`, for example, provides some
general raw data files relevant for both proteomics and
metabolomics.

```{r msdatafiles, message = FALSE}
library(msdata)
## proteomics raw data
proteomics()
## proteomics identification data
ident()
## quantitative data
quant()
```

More often, such *experiment packages* distribute processed data; an
example of such is the `r BiocStyle::Biocexptpkg("pRolocdata")`
package, that offers quantitative proteomics data.
