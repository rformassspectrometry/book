                  analysis due to peptide-specific effects and context
                  dependent missingness of peptide
                  intensities. Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob,
                  test for DE directly from peptide intensities and
                  outper-form summarization methods which first
                  aggregate MS1 peptide intensities to protein
                  intensities before DE analysis. However, these
                  methods are computationally expensive, often hard to
                  understand for the non-specialised end-user, and do
                  not provide protein summaries, which are important
                  for visualisation or downstream processing. In this
                  work, we therefore evaluate state-of-the-art
                  summarization strategies using a benchmark spike-in
                  dataset and discuss why and when these fail compared
                  to the state-of-the-art peptide based model,
                  MSqRob. Based on this evaluation, we propose a novel
                  summarization strategy, MSqRob-Sum, which estimates
                  MSqRob{\textquoteright}s model parameters in a
                  two-stage procedure circumventing the drawbacks of
                  peptide-based workflows. MSqRobSum maintains
                  MSqRob{\textquoteright}s superior performance, while
                  providing useful protein expression summaries for
                  plotting and downstream analysis. Summarising
                  peptide to protein intensities considerably reduces
                  the computational complexity, the memory footprint
                  and the model complexity, and makes it easier to
                  disseminate DE inferred on protein
                  summaries. Moreover, MSqRobSum provides a highly
                  modular analysis framework, which provides
                  researchers with full flexibility to develop data

              laboratories have developed quality control samples, there is no
              widely available performance standard of biological complexity
              (and associated reference data sets) for benchmarking of platform
              performance for analysis of complex biological proteomes across
              different laboratories in the community. Individual preparations
              of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome have been used
              extensively by laboratories in the proteomics community to
              characterize LC-MS platform performance. The yeast proteome is
              uniquely attractive as a performance standard because it is the
              most extensively characterized complex biological proteome and
              the only one associated with several large scale studies
              estimating the abundance of all detectable proteins. In this
              study, we describe a standard operating protocol for large scale
              production of the yeast performance standard and offer aliquots

              typical performance of commonly used ion trap instrument

              laboratories to benchmark their own performance, to improve upon

              platforms for detection of differentially expressed proteins at
              different levels of concentration in a complex matrix, thereby

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is actively
              embracing quantitative, single-cell level analyses. Indeed,
              recent advances in sample preparation and mass spectrometry (MS)
              have enabled the emergence of quantitative MS-based single-cell
              proteomics (SCP). While exciting and promising, SCP still has
              many rough edges. The current analysis workflows are custom and
              built from scratch. The field is therefore craving for
              standardized software that promotes principled and reproducible
              SCP data analyses. AREAS COVERED: This special report is the
              first step toward the formalization and standardization of SCP
              data analysis. scp, the software that accompanies this work,
              successfully replicates one of the landmark SCP studies and is
              applicable to other experiments and designs. We created a
              repository containing the replicated workflow with comprehensive
              documentation in order to favor further dissemination and
              improvements of SCP data analyses. EXPERT OPINION: Replicating
              SCP data analyses uncovers important challenges in SCP data
              analysis. We describe two such challenges in detail: batch
              correction and data missingness. We provide the current
              state-of-the-art and illustrate the associated limitations. We
              also highlight the intimate dependence that exists between batch
              effects and data missingness and offer avenues for dealing with
              these exciting challenges.",

               metabolomics experiments have become increasingly popular

               and the possibility to measure novel compounds. LC-MS
               instrumentation and analysis conditions can differ substantially

               non-standardized datasets demanding customized annotation
               workflows. We present an ecosystem of R packages, centered
               around the MetaboCoreUtils, MetaboAnnotation and CompoundDb
               packages that together provide a modular infrastructure for the
               annotation of untargeted metabolomics data. Initial annotation
               can be performed based on MS1 properties such as m/z and
               retention times, followed by an MS2-based annotation in which
               experimental fragment spectra are compared against a reference
               library. Such reference databases can be created and managed
               with the CompoundDb package. The ecosystem supports data from a
               variety of formats, including, but not limited to, MSP, MGF,
               mzML, mzXML, netCDF as well as MassBank text files and SQL
               databases. Through its highly customizable functionality, the
               presented infrastructure allows to build reproducible annotation
               workflows tailored for and adapted to most untargeted
               LC-MS-based datasets. All core functionality, which supports
               base R data types, is exported, also facilitating its re-use in
               other R packages. Finally, all packages are thoroughly
               unit-tested and documented and are available on GitHub and
               through Bioconductor.",

                  sample preparation process for conversion of
                  proteins into peptides, and quantification and

  abstract = "Mass spectrometry is unmatched in its versatility for studying
              practically any aspect of the proteome. Because the foundations
              of mass spectrometry-based proteomics are complex and span
              multiple scientific fields, proteomics can be perceived as having
              a high barrier to entry. This tutorial is intended to be an
              accessible illustrated guide to the technical details of a
              relatively simple quantitative proteomic experiment. An attempt
              is made to explain the relevant concepts to those with limited
              knowledge of mass spectrometry and a basic understanding of
              proteins. An experimental overview is provided, from the
              beginning of sample preparation to the analysis of protein group
              quantities, with explanations of how the data are acquired,
              processed, and analyzed. A selection of advanced topics is
              briefly surveyed and works for further reading are cited. To
              conclude, a brief discussion of the future of proteomics is
              given, considering next-generation protein sequencing
              technologies that may complement mass spectrometry to create a
              fruitful future for proteomics.",
