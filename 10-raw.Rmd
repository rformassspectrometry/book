# Raw MS data


In this section, we will learn how to read raw data from in one of the
commonly used open formats (`mzML`, `mzXML` and `netCDF`) into R.

```{r rwpkgs, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## x <- RforProteomics:::msDataTab()
## sel <- x[, 1] %in% c("Raw", "Peak lists")
## knitr::kable(x[sel, ])
```

```
|Data type  |File format   |Data structure               |Package           |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------------------------|:-----------------|
|Raw        |mzXML or mzML |mzRpwiz or mzRramp           |mzR               |
|Raw        |mzXML or mzML |list of MassSpectrum objects |MALDIquantForeign |
|Raw        |mzXML or mzML |MSnExp                       |MSnbase           |

|Raw        |several       |Spectra                      |Spectra           |
```

## What is raw data in R

When we manipulate complex data, we need a way to abstract it.

The need for and abstraction saves us from having to know about all
the details of that data **and** its associated metadata. This allows
to rely on a few easy-to-remember conventions to make mundane and
repetitive tasks trivial and be able to complete more complex things
easily. Abstractions provide a smoother approaches to handle complex
data using common patterns.

```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="Schematic representation of what is referred to by *raw data*: a collection of mass spectra and a table containing spectrum-level annotations along the lines. Raw data are imported from one of the many community-maintained open standards formats (mzML, mzXML, mzData or ANDI-MS/netCDF) (Figure taken from [@Gatto:2020]).", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/raw.png")
```

### The `Spectra` class

We are going to use the
[`Spectra`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Spectra/) package
as an abstraction to raw mass spectrometry data.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(Spectra)
```

`Spectra` is part of the [R for Mass Spectrometry
initiative](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) initiative. It
defines the `Spectra` class that is used as a raw data abstration, to
maniputate MS data and metadata. The best way to learn about a data
structure is to create one by hand.

Let's create a `DataFrame`^[As defined in the Bioconductor `S4Vectors`
package.] containing MS levels, retention time, m/z and intensities
for 2 spectra:

```{r, spectradata1}
spd <- DataFrame(msLevel = c(1L, 2L), rtime = c(1.1, 1.2))
spd$mz <- list(c(100, 103.2, 104.3, 106.5), c(45.6, 120.4, 190.2))
spd$intensity <- list(c(200, 400, 34.2, 17), c(12.3, 15.2, 6.8))
spd
```

And now convert this `DataFrame` into a `Spectra` object:

```{r, spectra1}
sp0 <- Spectra(spd)
sp0
```

#### Exercise {-}

Explore the newly created object using

- `spectraVariables` to extract all the metadata variables.
- `spectraData` to extract all the metadata.
- `peaksData` to extract a list containing thet raw data.
- `[` to create subsets.

### `Spectra` from mzML files

Let's now create a new object using the mzML data previously
downloaded and available in the `mzf` file.

```{r, spectra2}
mzf
sp <- Spectra(mzf)
sp
```

#### Exercise {-}

- Repeat the data manipulations above.
- Check the number of scans in the object with `length()`.
- Note the difference in the first line when showing the object in the
  console. We will get back to this idea of backend later.

Mass spectrometry data in `Spectra` objects can be thought of as a
list of individual spectra, with each spectrum having a set of
variables associated with it. Besides *core* spectra variables (such
as MS level or retention time) an arbitrary number of optional
variables can be assigned to a spectrum. The core spectra variables
all have their own accessor method and it is guaranteed that a value
is returned by it (or `NA` if the information is not available). The
core variables and their data type are (alphabetically ordered):

- *acquisitionNum* `integer(1)`: the index of acquisition of a
  spectrum during a MS run.
- *centroided* `logical(1)`: whether the spectrum is in profile or
  centroid mode.
- *collisionEnergy* `numeric(1)`: collision energy used to create an
  MSn spectrum.
- *dataOrigin* `character(1)`: the *origin* of the spectrum's data,
  e.g. the mzML file from which it was read.
- *dataStorage* `character(1)`: the (current) storage location of the
  spectrum data. This value depends on the backend used to handle and
  provide the data. For an *in-memory* backend like the
  `MsBackendDataFrame` this will be `"<memory>"`, for an on-disk
  backend such as the `MsBackendHdf5Peaks` it will be the name of the
  HDF5 file where the spectrum's peak data is stored.
- *intensity* `numeric`: intensity values for the spectrum's peaks.
- *isolationWindowLowerMz* `numeric(1)`: lower m/z for the isolation
  window in which the (MSn) spectrum was measured.
- *isolationWindowTargetMz* `numeric(1)`: the target m/z for the
  isolation window in which the (MSn) spectrum was measured.
- *isolationWindowUpperMz* `numeric(1)`: upper m/z for the isolation
  window in which the (MSn) spectrum was measured.
- *msLevel* `integer(1)`: the MS level of the spectrum.
- *mz* `numeric`: the m/z values for the spectrum's peaks.
- *polarity* `integer(1)`: the polarity of the spectrum (`0` and `1`
  representing negative and positive polarity, respectively).
- *precScanNum* `integer(1)`: the scan (acquisition) number of the
  precursor for an MSn spectrum.
- *precursorCharge* `integer(1)`: the charge of the precursor of an
  MSn spectrum.
- *precursorIntensity* `numeric(1)`: the intensity of the precursor of
  an MSn spectrum.
- *precursorMz* `numeric(1)`: the m/z of the precursor of an MSn
  spectrum.
- *rtime* `numeric(1)`: the retention time of a spectrum.
- *scanIndex* `integer(1)`: the index of a spectrum within a (raw)
  file.
- *smoothed* `logical(1)`: whether the spectrum was smoothed.

For details on the individual variables and their getter/setter
function see the help for `Spectra` (`?Spectra`). Also note that these
variables are suggested, but not required to characterize a
spectrum. Also, some only make sense for MSn, but not for MS1 spectra.

#### Exercise {-}

- Extract a set of spectra variables using the accessor (for example
  `msLevel(.)`) or using the `$` notation (for example `.$msLevel`).
- How many MS level are there, and how many scans of each level?
- Extract the index of the MS2 spectrum with the highest base peak
  intensity.
- Are the data centroided or in profile mode?
- Pick a spectrum of each level and visually check whether it is
  centroided or in profile mode. You can use the `plotSpectra()`
  function to visualise peaks and set the m/z range with the `xlim`
  arguments.

#### Exercise {-}

Using the first raw data file starting with `MS3TMT10`, answer the
following questions:

* How many spectra are there in that file?
* How many MS levels, and how many spectra per MS level?
* What is the index of the MS2 spectrum with the highest precursor
  intensity?
* Plot one spectrum of each level. Are they centroided or in profile
  mode?


These objects and their manipulations are not limited to single files:

```{r}
(fls <- dir(system.file("sciex", package = "msdata"), full.names = TRUE))
sp_sciex <- Spectra(fls)
table(dataOrigin(sp_sciex))
```

### Backends

Backends allow to use different *backends* to store mass spectrometry data while
providing *via* the `Spectra` class a unified interface to use that data. The
`Spectra` package defines a set of example backends but any object extending the
base `MsBackend` class could be used instead. The default backends are:

- `MsBackendMzR`: this backend keeps only general spectra variables in memory
  and relies on the `r Biocpkg("mzR")` package to read mass peaks (m/z and
  intensity values) from the original MS files on-demand.

```{r}
sp_sciex
```

- `MsBackendDataFrame`: the mass spectrometry data is stored (in-memory) in a
  `DataFrame`. Keeping the data in memory guarantees high performance but has
  also, depending on the number of mass peaks in each spectrum, a much higher
  memory footprint.


```{r}
setBackend(sp_sciex, MsBackendDataFrame())
```

- `MsBackendHdf5Peaks`: similar to `MsBackendMzR` this backend reads peak data
  only on-demand from disk while all other spectra variables are kept in
  memory. The peak data are stored in Hdf5 files which guarantees scalability.


```{r}
sp_hdf5 <- setBackend(sp_sciex, MsBackendHdf5Peaks(), hdf5path = tempdir())
sp_hdf5
table(sp_hdf5$dataOrigin)
table(sp_hdf5$dataStorage)
```

All of the above mentioned backends support changing all of their their spectra
variables, **except** the `MsBackendMzR` that does not support changing m/z or
intensity values for the mass peaks.

With the example below we load the data from a single mzML file and use a
`MsBackendHdf5Peaks` backend for data storage. The `hdf5path` parameter allows
us to specify the storage location of the HDF5 file.

There is also an (under development) SQLite-based backend called
[`MsBackendSqlDb`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/MsBackendSql/articles/MsBackendSqlDb.html)
that will store all data, i.e. raw and metadata, on disk.


## Under the hood: `mzR` (optional)

The `mzR` package in a direct interface to the
[proteowizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/) code base. It
includes a substantial proportion of *pwiz*'s C/C++ code for fast and
efficient parsing of these large raw data files.

Let's start by using some raw data files from the `msdata`
package. After loading it, we use the `proteomics()` function to
return the full file names for two raw data files. We will start by
focusing on the second one.

```{r rwfiles}
f <- msdata::proteomics(full.names = TRUE)
f
(f2 <- grep("20141210", f, value = TRUE))
```

The three main functions of `mzR` are

* `openMSfile` to create a file handle to a raw data file
* `header` to extract metadata about the spectra contained in the file
* `peaks` to extract one or multiple spectra of interest.

Other functions such as `instrumentInfo`, or `runInfo` can be used to
gather general information about a run.


```{r rawms}
library("mzR")
ms <- openMSfile(f2)
ms
```

```{r hd}
hd <- header(ms)
dim(hd)
names(hd)
```

```{r peaks}
head(peaks(ms, 117))
str(peaks(ms, 1:5))
```

#### Exercise {-}

Let's extract the index of the MS2 spectrum with the highest base peak
intensity and plot its spectrum. Is the data centroided or in profile
mode?

<details>

```{r ex_raw, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
hd2 <- hd[hd$msLevel == 2, ]
i <- which.max(hd2$basePeakIntensity)
hd2[i, ]
pi <- peaks(ms, hd2[i, 1])
plot(pi, type = "h")
mz <- hd2[i, "basePeakMZ"]
plot(pi, type = "h", xlim = c(mz - 0.5, mz + 0.5))
```

</details>

#### Exercise {-}

Pick an MS1 spectrum and visually check whether it is centroided or in
profile mode.

<details>

```{r ex_raw2}
## Zooming into spectrum 300 (an MS1 spectrum).
j <- 300
pj <- peaks(ms, j)
plot(pj, type = "l")
mz <- hd[j, "basePeakMZ"]
plot(pj, type = "l", xlim = c(mz - 0.5, mz + 0.5))
```
</details>


## Visualisation of raw MS data

The importance of flexible access to specialised data becomes visible
in the figure below (taken from the `RforProteomics` [visualisation
vignette](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/vignettes/RforProteomics/inst/doc/RProtVis.html)).
Not only can we access specific data and understand/visualise them,
but we can transverse all the data and extracted/visualise/understand
structured slices of data.


The figure below show is an illustration of how mass spectrometry
works:

1. The chromatogram at the top display to total ion current along the
   retention time. The vertical line identifies one scan in particular
   at retention time 1800.68 seconds (the 2807th scan).

2. The spectra on the second line represent the full MS1 spectrum
   marked by the red line. The vertical lines identify the 10
   precursor ions that where selected for MS2 analysis. The zoomed in
   on the right shows one specific precursor peak.

3. The MS2 spectra displayed along the two rows at the bottom are
   those resulting from the fragmentation of the 10 precursor peaks
   identified by the vertical bars above.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/msvisfig.png")
```

We are going to reproduce the figure above trought a set of exercices.

#### Exercise {-}

1.  The chromatogram can be created by extracting the `totIonCurrent`
   and `rtime` variables for all MS1 spectra. Annotate the spectrum of
   interest.

<details>

```{r}
with(spectraData(filterMsLevel(sp, 1)),
     plot(rtime, totIonCurrent, type = "l"))
abline(v = rtime(sp)[2807], col = "red")
```

</details>

2. The `filterPrecursorScan()` function can be used to retains parent
   (MS1) and children scans (MS2) of a scan, as defined by its
   acquisition number. Use it to extract the MS1 scan of interest and
   all its MS2 children.


<details>
```{r}
ms_2 <- filterPrecursorScan(sp, 2807)
ms_2
```
</details>

3. Plot the MS1 spectrum of interest and highlight all the peaks that
   will be selected for MS2 analysis.

<details>
```{r}
plotSpectra(sp[2807], xlim = c(400, 1000))
abline(v = precursorMz(ms_2)[-1], col = "grey")
abline(v = precursorMz(ms_2)[2], col = "red")
```
</details>

4. Zoom in mz values 521.1 and 522.5 to reveal the isotopic envelope
   of that peak.

<details>
```{r}
plotSpectra(sp[2807], xlim = c(521.2, 522.5), type = "l")
abline(v = precursorMz(ms_2)[2], col = "red")
```
</details>


5. The `plotSpectra()` function is used to plot all 10 MS2 spectra in
   one call.

<details>
```{r, fig.height = 12, fig.width = 8}
plotSpectra(ms_2[-1])
```
</details>


It is possible to label the peaks with the `plotSpectra()`
function. The `labels` argument is either a `character` of appropriate
length (i.e. with a label for each peak) or, as illustrated below, a
function that computes the labels.


```{r}
mzLabel <- function(z) {
    z <- peaksData(z)[[1L]]
    lbls <- format(z[, "mz"], digits = 4)
    lbls[z[, "intensity"] < 1e5] <- ""
    lbls
}

plotSpectra(ms_2[7],
            xlim = c(126, 132),
            labels = mzLabel,
            labelSrt = -30, labelPos = 2,
            labelOffset = 0.1)
```

Spectra can also be compared either by overlay or mirror plotting
using the `plotSpectraOverlay()` and `plotSpectraMirror()` functions.

#### Exercice {-}

1. Filter MS2 level spectra.
2. Find any 2 MS2 spectra that have matching precursor peaks based on
   the precursor m/z values.

<details>
```{r}
sp2 <- filterMsLevel(sp, 2L)
anyDuplicated(precursorMz(filterMsLevel(sp, 2)))
i <- which(precursorMz(sp2) == precursorMz(sp2)[37])
sp2i <- sp2[i]
```
</details>


3. Visualise the matching pair using the `plotSpectraOverlay()` and
   `plotSpectraMirror()` functions.

<details>
```{r}
plotSpectraOverlay(sp2i, col = c("red", "steelblue"))
```
```{r}
plotSpectraMirror(sp2i[1], sp2i[2])
```
</details>

## Raw data processing and manipulation

Apart from *classical* subsetting operations such as `[` and `split`,
a set of filter functions are defined for `Spectra` objects (for
detailed help please see the `?Spectra` help):

- `filterAcquisitionNum`: retain spectra with certain acquisition numbers.
- `filterDataOrigin`: subset to spectra from specific origins.
- `filterDataStorage`: subset to spectra from certain data storage files.
- `filterEmptySpectra`: remove spectra without mass peaks.
- `filterMzRange`: subset spectra keeping only peaks with an m/z within the
  provided m/z range.
- `filterMzValues`: subset spectra keeping only peaks matching provided m/z
  value(s).
- `filterIsolationWindow`: keep spectra with the provided `mz` in their
  isolation window (m/z range).
- `filterMsLevel`: filter by MS level.
- `filterPolarity`: filter by polarity.
- `filterPrecursorMz`: retain (MSn) spectra with a precursor m/z within the
  provided m/z range.
- `filterPrecursorScan`: retain (parent and children) scans of an acquisition
  number.
- `filterRt`: filter based on retention time ranges.


#### Exercise {-}

Using the `sp_sciex` data, select all spectra measured in the second
mzML file and subsequently filter them to retain spectra measured
between 175 and 189 seconds in the measurement run.

<details>

```{r filterfile-filterrt1}
fls <- unique(dataOrigin(sp_sciex))
fls
file_2 <- filterDataOrigin(sp_sciex, dataOrigin = fls[2])
length(file_2)
sps_sub <- filterRt(file_2, rt = c(175, 189))
length(sps_sub)
```

```{r filterfile-filterrt2}
library("magrittr")
sp_sciex %>%
    filterDataOrigin(fls[2]) %>%
    filterRt(c(175, 189))
```
</details>

As an example of data processing, below we use the `pickPeaks()`
function to pick peaks:

```{r}
plotSpectra(sp[2807], xlim = c(521.2, 522.5))
```

```{r}
library("magrittr")
pickPeaks(sp[2807]) %>%
    filterIntensity(1e7) %>%
    plotSpectra(xlim = c(521.2, 522.5))
```

## A note on efficiency

### Backends


```{r, results='markup', fig.cap="(a) Reading time (triplicates, in seconds) and (b) data size in memory (in MB) to read/store 1, 5, and 10 files containing 1431 MS1 (on-disk only) and 6103 MS2 (on-disk and in-memory) spectra. (c) Filtering benchmark assessed over 10 interactions on in-memory and on-disk data containing 6103 MS2 spectra. (d) Access time to spectra for the in-memory (left) and on-disk (right) backends for 1, 10, 100 1000, 5000, and all 6103 spectra. Benchmarks were performed on a Dell XPS laptop with an Intel i5-8250U processor 1.60 GHz (4 cores, 8 threads), 7.5 GB RAM running Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS 64-bit, and an SSD drive. The data used for the benchmarking are a TMT 4-plex experiment acquired on a LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific) available in the msdata package . (Figure taken from [@Gatto:2020].", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/pr0c00313_0002.gif")
```

### Parallel processing

Most functions on `Spectra` support (and use) parallel processing out
of the box. Peak data access and manipulation methods perform by
default parallel processing on a per-file basis (i.e. using the
dataStorage variable as splitting factor). Spectra uses
[`BiocParallel`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocParallel) for
parallel processing and all functions use the default registered
parallel processing setup of that package.

### Lazy evaluation

Data manipulations on Spectra objects are not immediately applied to
the peak data. They are added to a so called processing queue which is
applied each time peak data is accessed (with the `peaksData`, `mz` or
`intensity` functions). Thanks to this processing queue data
manipulation operations are also possible for read-only backends
(e.g. mzML-file based backends or database-based backends). The
information about the number of such processing steps can be seen
below (next to Lazy evaluation queue).


```{r}
min(intensity(sp_sciex[1]))
sp_sciex <- filterIntensity(sp_sciex, intensity = c(10, Inf))
sp_sciex ## Note the lazy evaluation queue
min(intensity(sp_sciex[1]))
sp_sciex@processingQueue
```


```{r}
sp_sciex <- reset(sp_sciex)
sp_sciex@processingQueue
min(intensity(sp_sciex[1]))
```
